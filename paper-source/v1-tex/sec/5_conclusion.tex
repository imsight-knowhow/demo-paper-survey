\section{Conclusion}

We propose StreamDiffusion, a pipeline-level solution for interactive diffusion generation. StreamDiffusion consists of several optimization strategies for both throughput and GPU usage, including Stream Batch with cross-attention, residual classifier-free guidance (R-CFG), IO-queue for parallelization, stochastic similarity filter, pre-computation, Tiny AutoEncoder, and the use of the model acceleration tool. The synergistic combination of these elements results in a marked improvement in efficiency. Specifically, StreamDiffusion achieves up to 91.07 frames per second (fps) on a standard consumer-grade GPU for image generation tasks. This performance level is particularly beneficial for a variety of applications, including but not limited to the Metaverse, online video streaming, and broadcasting sectors. Furthermore, StreamDiffusion demonstrates a significant reduction in GPU power consumption, achieving at least a 1.99x decrease. This notable efficiency gain underscores StreamDiffusion's potential for commercial application, offering a compelling solution for energy-conscious, high-performance computing environments.
